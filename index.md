#### Congressional District

This is an interactive map that shows, by Congressional District, the percentage of schools with greater than 100 students that are passed, within 200 meters, by consumer-ready fiber facilities (=>100Mbps).  It does not show what percent of schools actually subscribe to high-speed data services. These figures are based on data from the National Broadband Map (June 2013) and NCES Public School Data.

#### About
{#about}

On July 23, 2014, the Wireline Competition Bureau initiated a thorough review of the E-rate program (more formally known as the schools and libraries universal service support mechanism).  Increasingly, schools and libraries require high-capacity broadband connections to take advantage of digital learning technologies that hold the promise of substantially improving educational experiences and expanding opportunity for students, teachers, parents and whole communities. When Congress passed the Telecommunications Act of 1996 authorizing the creation of the E-rate program, only 14 percent of classrooms had access to the Internet, and most schools with internet access (74 percent) used dial-up connections.  By 2005 nearly all schools had access to the Internet, and by 2006, nearly all public libraries were connected to the Internet.  The challenge now is modernizing the program to ensure that our nation’s students and communities have access to high-capacity broadband connections that support digital learning.  This map demonstrates our current progress towards that goal.

##### Privacy

The FCC has taken significant measures to ensure the privacy and confidentiality of volunteers for this program. All data is collected anonymously, and no personally-identifiable information is collected.
